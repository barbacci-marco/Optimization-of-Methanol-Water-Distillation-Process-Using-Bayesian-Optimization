# Optimization-of-Methanol-Water-Distillation-Process-Using-Bayesian-Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing a methanol-water distillation process using Bayesian Optimization. By adjusting reflux flow rate, distillate flow rate, and temperature, the goal is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining product purity. Data-driven models and machine learning enhance efficiency and reduce experimental time.
This project focuses on the process optimization of a methanol-water distillation system using a machine learning-driven approach. The primary goal is to determine the optimal operating conditions that minimize the energy consumption while ensuring a high product purity. The key operating variables considered are the reflux flow rate, distillate flow rate, and column temperature.

A core component of this project is the use of Bayesian Optimizationâ€”a machine learning-based optimization technique particularly useful for expensive or complex processes with unknown response surfaces. The Bayesian Optimization framework efficiently explores the parameter space, seeking to find the optimal setpoints that reduce operational costs while maintaining or improving process performance.

The steps involved in the project include:

Data Collection: Experimental data is collected from a lab-scale distillation rig, recording values such as reflux flow rate, distillate flow rate, temperature, product purity, and energy consumption. This data is stored in an Excel file for analysis.

Interpolation Models: Interpolation techniques are applied to model the relationship between the process variables (reflux flow rate, distillate flow rate, temperature) and the system outputs (purity and energy consumption). These models allow for predictions of purity and energy at any given operating point within the specified ranges.

Cost Function Development: A cost function is developed to quantify the overall performance of the distillation process, combining energy consumption and product purity. Penalties are imposed on solutions that fail to meet minimum purity requirements.

Bayesian Optimization: Using the gp_minimize function from the scikit-optimize library, Bayesian Optimization is applied to find the optimal operating conditions. The algorithm iteratively refines its search, balancing exploration of new parameter combinations with the exploitation of known good solutions, minimizing the cost function with a limited number of evaluations.

Analysis and Visualization: The results of the optimization are analyzed and visualized, showing how different operating points affect the process efficiency and purity. The optimal conditions identified by the Bayesian optimizer are compared with traditional methods of process optimization.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Integration: Leverages machine learning to optimize complex, non-linear processes.
Bayesian Optimization: Minimizes the number of experiments required to find the optimal setpoints, reducing time and resource usage.
Data-Driven Approach: Utilizes experimental data from the lab to build predictive models of the distillation system.
Economic Focus: Balances energy consumption and product purity for cost-effective operation.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: Programming language for scripting and implementation.
Pandas: For handling and reading Excel data.
Scikit-Optimize (skopt): For Bayesian Optimization of the process parameters.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the results of the optimization.
Scikit-learn: For interpolation models and additional machine learning tools.

This project represents a modern approach to process optimization by integrating machine learning into chemical engineering workflows, ensuring more efficient and cost-effective operations in industrial applications.
